installation and running instructions for freqFind are as follows:
	necessary components:
		python 2.7
		R (seqLogo only)

	Download all scripts in bin/ as well as every file with the start GO (GO*) as well as freqFind into the same directory 
	Download all MATRIX files (MATRIX_ANNOTATION, MATRIX_PROTEIN, MATRIX_DATA, MATRIX_SORTED_DATA) into the same directroy as the GO and freqFind files
	Download jaspar_species_converter and pdbmap.txt into the same directory as the other scripts

	Download a bed file from ensemble BioMart with the following headers:
		Ensembl_Gene_ID        Chromosome_Name         Gene_Start_(bp)         Gene_End_(bp)   Strand  Associated_Gene_Name    UniProt/SwissProt_ID    UniProt/SwissProt_Accession

How to Run freqFind

	./freqFind  BED_FILE ORGANISM SEARCH_TERM BASE_NAME GENOME_DIR INTERACTION P_VALUE
		Where:
                BED_FILE- ensemble bed file (must be in same directory)
                ORGANISM- text to determine which species transcription factors to generate, currently recognized are mouse,human,celegans,fly and yeast
                SEARCH_TERM-term used in grep to find classes or families of TFs (case insensitve)
                BASE_NAME-user specified name for files
                GENOME_DIR-location of the genome files in fasta format
                INTERACTION- True or False, specifying if only a list of TF and gene headers are wanted and not sequence information
                P_VALUE- p-value specified by user


this will create new folders ORGANISM,search_regions, and a BASE_NAME.output file
	ORGANISM will contain the seqLogo and total frequency matrix information
	search_regions will contain the upstream regions searched by freqFind
	BASE_NAME.output file will contain the final locations and identifications of genes based on the transcription factor headers
