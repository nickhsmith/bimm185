MOODS version 1.0.1
=======================

MOODS is a suite of algorithms for matching position weight matrices (PWM) against DNA sequences. It features advanced matrix matching algorithms implemented in C++ that can be used to scan hundreds of matrices against chromosome-sized sequences in few seconds.

MOODS has been designed to be used as a library wherever PWM matching is needed. It can be used as standalone analysis tool or as a component in larger programs. It contains interfaces for BioPerl and Biopython toolkits. MOODS can thus be easily called from C++, Python and Perl programs.

MOODS is licenced under GPL version 3 license and under the Biopython license, so you may use it under terms of either of those licenses. See COPYING.GPLv3 and COPYING.BIOPYTHON files for license details.

MOODS has been written by Pasi Rastas, Janne Korhonen and Petri Martinm√§ki. The project is currently maintained by Janne Korhonen (jazkorho@cs.helsinki.fi).


INSTALLATION

You need to compile the C++ library before installing the Perl and Python interfaces. This can be done by running "make" in the "src" directory.

Installing extensions:
- For perl extension see perl/README.
- For python extension see python/README
